Inverse problem in advection diffusion equation : Source localisation



Abstract : 

The advection-diffusion equation is involved in various domains (fluids mechanics, semiconductors physics, stochastics process, financial mathematics). 
We will take a closer look at its application towards atmospheric dispersion (example : smoke plume of a factory).
We will then demonstrate the existence and unicity of the solution of the problem formed by the advection-diffusion equation, the boundary conditions and the initial conditions. 
Nevertheless, apart from some simple cases,  there is usually no analytic expression of the solution.
Thus, we need numerical analysis methods to solve the problem. The finite difference and the finite elements are the chosen ones. 
The second one is more effective but harder to implement.
Finally, thanks to the numerical solution we can solve the inverse problem. The goal is to identify the shape of the source term from the boundary data.
